The aim of this study is to understand the many types of neurons that carry out information processing in the brain evolved recently by focusing on the retina, the thin film of neurons in the eye that initiates vision. Our approach entails high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq where gene expression is quantified in hundreds of thousands of single retinal neurons, and computational methods are used to process and integrate these datasets. We have recently completed a project that involves generating and integrating single-cell RNA-seq data across an unprecedented 17 species.
